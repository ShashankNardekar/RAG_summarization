# Document Summarization RAG Prototype

## Overview

This repository outlines the development of a prototype for a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed for summarizing large documents. Utilizing the power of OpenAI GPT, LlamaIndex, and Weights & Biases (W&B), this solution aims to enhance the contextuality and accuracy of document summarization.

### Key Components

- **OpenAI GPT**: Serves as the backbone for generating summaries by leveraging advanced natural language processing capabilities.
- **LlamaIndex**: Facilitates the segmentation of large PDF documents into manageable chunks and embedding their contents for efficient retrieval.
- **Weights & Biases (W&B)**: Used for tracking experiments, monitoring model performance, and optimizing the RAG system setup.

## Approach

### 1. Load a PDF Document Using LlamaIndex PDFReader

- The PDF document, focusing on 'AI and Big Data in Finance', acts as an external context source, enabling the Language Model (LLM) to generate more context-based summaries.

### 2. Segment and Embed the PDF Content

- Large PDFs are segmented into chunks, and their contents are embedded using a pretrained model. This process facilitates the enrichment of context for the LLM.

### 3. Save Embedded Vectors Using VectorStore

- The embedded vectors are stored using VectorStore, allowing them to be queried by the LLM for retrieving enriched contextual information.

### 4. Set Up the RAG System Using LLAMAIndex ServiceContext

- ServiceContext is employed to prepare the LLM for processing and retrieving information based on the embeddings, effectively setting up the RAG system.

### 5. A Working RAG System Prototype

- With the RAG system set up, the prototype can efficiently summarize the PDF and answer queries related to the document, leveraging the context provided by the PDF's content.

## Conclusion

This prototype demonstrates a novel approach to document summarization, enhancing the capability to generate concise and contextually relevant summaries and answers from extensive documents. By integrating OpenAI GPT, LlamaIndex, and W&B, this solution paves the way for more advanced RAG systems in the field of document processing and summarization.
